# Adventure-Game
Introduction

Inspired by RPGs, this is a text based adventure game prototype written in Python. I am releasing it to demonstrate expertise in Python, but please do not modify it unless you contact me first. This was inspired by a D&D tabletop game I played once with a group, while I investigated gameplay mechanics. The story was a collaboration between Ai and some of my own writing ror a novel. Enjoy!
